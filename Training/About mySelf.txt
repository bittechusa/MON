Most of my project was in agile methodology.Mostly i have worked in two weeks sprint sometimes three weeks also.In my career I used Selenium IDE and Selenium Webdriver to automate my browser. But I like to use Selenium Webdriver. When  I wrote my Script I used Java language and I used Eclipse as a editor. To build my project I used Maven as a project builder. In my project I used Junit and testng as a framework. To schedule my project I used Jenkins continuous intregation tools. I used GIT as a version  controller. For my project report, I used log4J and Junit plugin in Jenkins to debugging my bug or error. I used quality center and testing to write my test plan and test case. I used JIRA as a test debug tools.I Wrote sql query to retrieve any data from database. To summarize myself, I like to say I am expert automation testing as well as manual.
